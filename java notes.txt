Interface 

Interface is a blueprint of a class with absract methods in it. Absract methods are methods which are not implemented. THe class which implements the interface defines the abstarct methods in an Interface.

Example Queue is an interface while using Queue we will use it as 
Queue<Integer> queue = new Linkedlist<>(); Here we use LinkedList<>() because LinkedList implements the Deque since Deque extends Queue, Methods in Queue are also implemented in it.
