TreeMap<Integer,Integer> it is a map where keys in it are stored in sorted manner and it uses binary search to find any key. Therefore it takes Log(N) time to find the key.

Interface 

Interface is a blueprint of a class with absract methods in it. Absract methods are methods which are not implemented. THe class which implements the interface defines the abstarct methods in an Interface.

Example Queue is an interface while using Queue we will use it as 
Queue<Integer> queue = new Linkedlist<>(); Here we use LinkedList<>() because LinkedList implements the Deque since Deque extends Queue, Methods in Queue are also implemented in it.

Wrapper class it helps convert datatype to object. Integer and int n other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.
Anonymous class helps to override or implement the methods of a class.

interface Polygon {
   public void display();
}

class AnonymousDemo {
   public void createClass() {

      // anonymous class implementing interface
      Polygon p1 = new Polygon() {
         public void display() {
            System.out.println("Inside an anonymous class.");
         }
      };
      p1.display();
   }
}

class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      AnonymousDemo an = new AnonymousDemo();
      an.createClass();
   }
}
Ouput: Inside an anonymous class.
